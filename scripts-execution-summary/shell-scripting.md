Each script section uses the same **four-part** model:

| # | Column in tables | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **What it is** | Command or shell feature (e.g. `echo` = print text). |
| 2 | **Added / configured** | How it appears in Linux (PATH, builtin, flag on CLI, variable in script). |
| 3 | **Execution intent** | What you are trying to do when the line runs. |
| 4 | **Output** | What you see on the **terminal (stdout/stderr)**, in a **file**, or through a **pipeline** (`|`). |

## [`backup-logs.sh`](../scripts/shell-scripting/backup-logs.sh)

**Run:** `bash scripts/shell-scripting/backup-logs.sh`

### In-depth command walkthrough

| Command (as in script) | 1. What it is | 2. Added / configured | 3. Execution intent | 4. Output (terminal / file / pipeline) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `set -euo pipefail` | Bash strict-mode option bundle. | Written at top of script; not installed separately. | Tell Bash to stop on errors, treat unset variables as errors, and fail pipelines if any stage fails. | No visible output; changes how later commands affect exit status. |
| `SRC="${1:-./exercises/03-redirection-pipes/sample}"` | Shell syntax (variable, test, subshell, or function). | Defined in this script only. | Prepare path, branch on failure, or wrap commands. | Depends on line: may be silent or print via embedded commands. |
| `DEST="${2:-/tmp}"` | Shell syntax (variable, test, subshell, or function). | Defined in this script only. | Prepare path, branch on failure, or wrap commands. | Depends on line: may be silent or print via embedded commands. |
| `STAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)` | Shell variable assignment. | Name=`value` in script; often under `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}`. | Store path or stamp for later commands (setup, not a user command). | No output; variable used by `cd`, `rm`, file paths. |
| `ARCHIVE="$DEST/linux-basics-backup-$STAMP.tar.gz"` | Shell syntax (variable, test, subshell, or function). | Defined in this script only. | Prepare path, branch on failure, or wrap commands. | Depends on line: may be silent or print via embedded commands. |
| `tar -czf "$ARCHIVE" -C "$(dirname "$SRC")" "$(basename "$SRC")"` | Archive files. | GNU tar; `-czf` gzip compress. | Create backup archive with timestamp name. | Creates file on disk; message on stdout in demo scripts. |
| `echo "Created $ARCHIVE"` | Bash builtin that prints arguments to standard output. | Always available in Bash; no package install. | Show section titles, tips, or messages to the terminal (trying to **print** text for the user). | Lines appear on **stdout** in your terminal (or in CI logs). Not used in a pipeline unless followed by `|`. |

## [`check-file.sh`](../scripts/shell-scripting/check-file.sh)

**Run:** `bash scripts/shell-scripting/check-file.sh`

### In-depth command walkthrough

| Command (as in script) | 1. What it is | 2. Added / configured | 3. Execution intent | 4. Output (terminal / file / pipeline) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `FILE="${1:?Usage: $0 <file>}"` | Shell variable assignment. | Name=`value` in script; often under `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}`. | Store path or stamp for later commands (setup, not a user command). | No output; variable used by `cd`, `rm`, file paths. |
| `if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then` | Conditional test `[[ ... ]]` or `if`. | Bash syntax. | Branch: run block only when directory exists / command succeeds. | Either block runs (messages on stdout) or `else` branch. |
| `echo "$FILE exists ($(wc -l < "$FILE") lines)"` | Bash builtin that prints arguments to standard output. | Always available in Bash; no package install. | Show section titles, tips, or messages to the terminal (trying to **print** text for the user). | Lines appear on **stdout** in your terminal (or in CI logs). Not used in a pipeline unless followed by `|`. |
| `echo "$FILE does not exist" >&2` | Bash builtin that prints arguments to standard output. | Always available in Bash; no package install. | Show section titles, tips, or messages to the terminal (trying to **print** text for the user). | Lines appear on **stdout** in your terminal (or in CI logs). Not used in a pipeline unless followed by `|`. |
| `exit 1` | Shell syntax (variable, test, subshell, or function). | Defined in this script only. | Prepare path, branch on failure, or wrap commands. | Depends on line: may be silent or print via embedded commands. |

## [`hello.sh`](../scripts/shell-scripting/hello.sh)

**Run:** `bash scripts/shell-scripting/hello.sh`

### In-depth command walkthrough

| Command (as in script) | 1. What it is | 2. Added / configured | 3. Execution intent | 4. Output (terminal / file / pipeline) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `COURSE="${1:-Linux Basics}"` | Shell syntax (variable, test, subshell, or function). | Defined in this script only. | Prepare path, branch on failure, or wrap commands. | Depends on line: may be silent or print via embedded commands. |
| `echo "Hello from $0"` | Bash builtin that prints arguments to standard output. | Always available in Bash; no package install. | Show section titles, tips, or messages to the terminal (trying to **print** text for the user). | Lines appear on **stdout** in your terminal (or in CI logs). Not used in a pipeline unless followed by `|`. |
| `echo "Studying: $COURSE"` | Bash builtin that prints arguments to standard output. | Always available in Bash; no package install. | Show section titles, tips, or messages to the terminal (trying to **print** text for the user). | Lines appear on **stdout** in your terminal (or in CI logs). Not used in a pipeline unless followed by `|`. |
| `echo "Argument count: $#"` | Bash builtin that prints arguments to standard output. | Always available in Bash; no package install. | Show section titles, tips, or messages to the terminal (trying to **print** text for the user). | Lines appear on **stdout** in your terminal (or in CI logs). Not used in a pipeline unless followed by `|`. |
